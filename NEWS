Version 1.5:
------------
(by Heidi Seibold & Wolfgang Lederer)

* Option fitting.method in function simex() now works properly for "linear" (Wolfgang)

* Measurement errors may now be heteroscedastic. Therefore the input-type had (Heidi)
  to be changed. The measurement error now has to be a matrix.

* The functions simex and print.summary.simex were adjusted. (Heidi)




Version 1.4:
------------
(by Ph. Grosjean <phgrosjean@sciviews.org>)

* Object classes were renamed 'simex' and 'mcsimex' to match their constructor's
  names simex() and mcsimex().

* Interface of mcsimex() has been homogenized with the one of simex(), with
  fitting.method at the sixth place instead of last one.

* print() methods now return x invisibly, as they are supposed to do.

* predict() methods failed when newdata was not provided. Fixed.

* refit() is now a generic function with methods for objects 'simex' and
  'mcsimex'. Its arguments have been reworked to match arguments of simex()
  and mcsimex() functions (jackknife becomes jackknife.estimation).

* A NAMESPACE is added and functions that are not supposed to be used by the
  end-user are now hidden in the namespace (construct.s(), fit.log() and
  fit.nls()).

* Documentation has been rewritten to match current R standards. Methods are now
  documented in the same page as the object creator. 'Overview' is rewritten and
  renamed 'simex-package'.
